## Espeak

The `Espeak` script is a simple command-line interface that converts text to speech. It utilizes the `espeak` Linux command-line tool to generate speech from the provided text input.

## Image Resizer

The `Image Resizer` script allows for resizing images using the `numpy` and `cv2` libraries. By specifying the desired dimensions, the script resizes the input image accordingly, maintaining the aspect ratio.

## PdfMerger

The `PdfMerger` script leverages the `PyPDF2` library to merge two PDF files. It takes two PDF files as input and generates a merged PDF file with the combined content of the input files.

## Weather App

The `Weather App` script fetches weather data using a weather API, transforms the data into a usable format, and utilizes the `espeak` Linux command-line tool to convert temperature, rainfall, and humidity data into speech. The script provides an audio output of the weather information.
